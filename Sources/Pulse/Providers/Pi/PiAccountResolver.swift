/// Resolves pi's provider keys (`anthropic`, `anthropic-2`, …) to the Anthropic
/// account each one signs in as.
///
/// **Why this exists, and why the obvious shortcut is wrong.** pi names accounts
/// by position in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` and records nothing else about them:
/// no email, no account id, only the key on each message. The first version of
/// this integration therefore mapped `anthropic` → the primary account and
/// `anthropic-N` → the Nth, on the assumption that the accounts were added in
/// the same order everywhere.
///
/// Measured 2026-09-01 against `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/profile`, that
/// assumption was **exactly backwards on this machine**:
///
/// ```
/// pi "anthropic"   -> elara@datainnovation.io   (Pulse's Claude Elara tab)
/// pi "anthropic-2" -> joel@datainnovation.io    (Pulse's Claude tab)
/// ```
///
/// 153.4M tokens — effectively all pi usage — were being billed to the wrong
/// tab, and nothing about the numbers looked wrong: they were plausible, they
/// were on a real account, and they added up. Only the account's owner could
/// tell. That is the whole argument for resolving identity instead of guessing
/// order: an ordering assumption fails silently and consistently.
///
/// **How it resolves.** One `GET /api/oauth/profile` per pi key, using the
/// token pi already holds, returning `account.uuid` — the same uuid Claude Code
/// writes into `<configDir>/.claude.json` as `oauthAccount.accountUuid`. Both
/// sides then agree on an identity neither of them made up.
///
/// **Cost control.** The answer is cached on disk keyed by a *fingerprint of
/// the token*, so the call happens once per key and again only when pi signs
/// that key in again (new token ⇒ possibly a different account ⇒ must
/// re-resolve). Pulse never refreshes the token: an expired one is skipped, not
/// rotated, because rotating it would break pi's own session.
///
/// **When it cannot resolve** (offline, expired token, no cache yet), the key's
/// sessions are attributed to **no account at all**. Dropping usage is visible
/// and recoverable; putting it on the wrong account is neither.
