# WHY THIS EXISTS: `swift test` cannot run on a machine without Xcode (the
# `Testing` module is unavailable, so *every* test file fails to compile — not
# just new ones). CI runs the real suite; this harness is how the same logic is
# verified locally, by compiling the real source files with `swiftc` and
# asserting against them, including a live read of this machine's counters. It
# is not a substitute for Tests/PulseTests/SystemMonitorTests.swift, it is a
# second, independent check that also plants known defects and requires each to
# be caught.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/verify-system-stats.sh
