#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Standalone verifier for the "Count Tokens From" switches, end to end:
# Settings writes UsageSourceGate, ClaudeProvider reads it, and the breakdown
# it returns actually loses (only) that source's sessions.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the switch, the gate and the reader sit in three different
# layers. Each can be correct in isolation while the wire between them is cut,
# and the symptom is a toggle that silently does nothing. `swift test` cannot
# run here (no `Testing` module without Xcode), so the real sources are compiled
# with `swiftc` and asserted against, with known defects planted afterwards.
#
# Reads the live ~/.claude, ~/.jcode and ~/.pi trees read-only.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/verify-usage-sources.sh
